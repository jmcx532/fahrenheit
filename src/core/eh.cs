/* [fkelava 11/06/26 23:02]
 * .NET has two 'unhandled exception handlers' - AppDomain.UnhandledException
 * and ExceptionHandling.SetUnhandledExceptionHandler (.NET 10+). They have different semantics.
 *
 * Furthermore, some of these are only raised for some classes of exceptions.
 * Here's the table I've been able to piece together:
 *                                           AD.FC | AD.UE | SUEH
 * ---
 * Exception on user-spawned thread             X      X      X
 * Exception on application main thread         X      X      -
 * Exception on application non-main thread     X      -      -
 * Task exception (unobserved)                  X      -      -
 * ---
 * We install the 'newer' ExceptionHandling API.
 *
 * Stage 0 acts as an underlying crash handler, and it will process
 * any unhandled exceptions or fatal errors (AV/EEE). This can be simplified
 * down the line with https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/101560.

     * There is one edge case in which this will throw; a failure in initializing `FhEnvironment.Finder`,
     * because `FhLogger` relies on it. But initializing it is the first act Fahrenheit does _after_ installing EH,
     * so the window in which that can happen is vanishingly brief (and Finder itself will only fail if we can't
     * R/W to our own directory...)
